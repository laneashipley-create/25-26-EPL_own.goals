## API Details

- **API**: Sportradar Soccer v4 (trial)
- **Season**: `sr:season:130281` — Premier League 25/26
- **Competition**: `sr:competition:17` — English Premier League
- **Own goal detection**: `timeline.type == "score_change" && timeline.method == "own_goal"`

## Running the Pipeline

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.12+ (installed via winget)

### One-shot (all steps)
```powershell
$env:PYTHONUTF8="1"
python run_all.py
```

### Individual steps (useful for refreshing data)
```powershell
# Refresh schedule only
python step2_get_schedule.py

# Fetch any new/missing timelines (safe to re-run — already-cached files are skipped)
python step3_fetch_timelines.py

# Re-extract own goals from cached timelines
python step4_extract_own_goals.py

# Rebuild HTML report
python generate_report.py
```

---

## Rate Limiting

The trial API key allows **1 request/second**. `step3_fetch_timelines.py` enforces a 1.1 second delay between requests. With 261 completed matches, the first run takes ~5 minutes. Subsequent runs only fetch new matches.

## Data Notes

- **`data/schedule.csv`**: Includes all 393 matches (261 completed, 132 upcoming as of project start). Statuses: `closed`/`ended` = completed.
- **`data/timelines/`**: Raw JSON cached per match. Filenames are the sport event ID with colons replaced by underscores.
- **`data/own_goals.csv`**: One row per own goal with: player name, team, minute, benefiting team, score at time of OG, final score, commentary text.
- The `og_player_team` field is the team the scorer **plays for** (the unfortunate one); `benefiting_team` is who it counts as a goal for.
