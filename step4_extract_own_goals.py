STEP 4 — Scan cached timelines and extract own goal events.

Own goals are identified by:
    timeline event: type == "score_change"  AND  method == "own_goal"

For each own goal, we extract:
    match_date, home_team, away_team, round,
    og_player, og_player_team (the team the scorer plays for — i.e. the LOSING team),
    benefiting_competitor (home/away),
    minute, stoppage_time,
    home_score_after, away_score_after,
    final_home_score, final_away_score,
    commentary, sport_event_id
